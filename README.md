# Jupyter Notebook Beginner Guide Project

## Description

This project is based on the instructions provided in the "Jupyter Notebook Complete Beginner Guide on Google Colab and Kaggle" video by Rob Mulla, which can be found on YouTube. As a complete beginner, I followed the step-by-step instructions provided in the video to learn how to use Jupyter Notebook effectively on Google Colab and Kaggle platforms.

The project consists of a series of Jupyter Notebook files created according to the instructions in the video. Each notebook covers various topics such as data loading, data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, using Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

## Contents

- Introduction to Jupyter Notebook
- Setting up Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook files locally or on Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook files using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.
4. Experiment with the code and explore different functionalities.
